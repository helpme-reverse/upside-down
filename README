 Lab03: upside-down
===================

   You can implement 'stack' in various other ways. In this weird new world,
   stack grows upwards (towards higher memory addresses), rather than growing
   from higher to lower addresses like a 'normal' stack.
   
   Who knows? The world we are living in might be the weird world but we
   somehow got used to it.
